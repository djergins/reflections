What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

it creates the .git file that keeps track of the repository and holds metadata
for the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers? 

The staging area is where you place files that you intend to commit to your git repository. This is useful because it gives you the ability to customize what you wish to commit to your repo.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Commit only the changes that are pertinent to the logical change that you wish to implement.
